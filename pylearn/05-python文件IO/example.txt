kind
kind lets you run Kubernetes on your local computer. This tool requires that you have either Docker or Podman installed.

The kind Quick Start page shows you what you need to do to get up and running with kind.


minikube
Like kind, minikube is a tool that lets you run Kubernetes locally. minikube runs an all-in-one or a multi-node local Kubernetes cluster on your personal computer (including Windows, macOS and Linux PCs) so that you can try out Kubernetes, or for daily development work.

You can follow the official Get Started! guide if your focus is on getting the tool installed.


Once you have minikube working, you can use it to run a sample application.

kubeadm
You can use the kubeadm tool to create and manage Kubernetes clusters. It performs the actions necessary to get a minimum viable, secure cluster up and running in a user friendly way.
